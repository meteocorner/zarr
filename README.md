# zarr
the operation of .zarr data and mapping 

*zarr* (multidimensional array data) is the format storing simulated meteorological data, which is used in my master's thesis. In this repository, the data reading and further processing, mapping (*geopandas*, *HEALPix*) with Python are shown. Note the script is not complete.
